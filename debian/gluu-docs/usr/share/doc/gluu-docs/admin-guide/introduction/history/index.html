<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<h2 id="how-we-got-started">How we got started</h2>
<p>Gluu was founded in 2009 by Mike Schwartz. After selling his ISP to Verio in 1998, Mike
advised many large companies on identity and access management, directory services, and
application security. In late 2008, Mike had a hunch that Web single sign-on
was too complex, too proprietary and too expensive for many organizations. He felt that
a utility approach to SSO using open source software could provide an alternative to
expensive enterprise solutions. The Gluu Server was envisioned as an integrated
identity platform, based on free open source software, to make application security available
to significantly greater number of organizations.</p>
<h2 id="early-days-versions-1-and-2">Early days : versions 1 and 2</h2>
<p>Versions 1 of the Gluu Server was based on Sun OpenSSO and OpenDS. Mike
presented the idea at an OpenSSO community group at the European Identity Conference in Munich in May 2009.
Version 1 worked a little, but there was no easy way to manage it. Version 2 of the Gluu Server had a better UI, but
it was just a facade--the UI didn't actually do anything to configure OpenSSO. Version 2 was launched after
Mike Schwartz met with members of the InCommon steering committee in San Antonio in October 2009.
At that meeting, Mike expressed concern that OpenSSO might be end-of-life. Oracle had recently purchased
Sun Microsystems, and before ForgeRock was formed, it seemed possible that Oracle would simply
migrate OpenSSO customers to Oracle Access Manager. Bob convinced Mike that the Shibboleth IDP was a reasonable
alternative, and arguably had even more features in SAML, including fine grain access release policies, and
a better approach for multi-party federation. As the InCommon federation's efforts to evangelize SAML federation
would support Gluu's message, switching had marketing advantages, and would reduce the
event risk around OpenSSO. Shortly thereafter, a
new project from scratch was launched for Gluu Server v3 with the goal of using templates to simplify the
management of the Shibboleth IDP.</p>
<h2 id="v3-gluu-server-ships">V3: Gluu Server Ships!</h2>
<p>The first live demo of the Gluu Server was at an InCommon event in Atlanta, GA in early November 2010.
At that demo, Hakeem Fahm, then IT director at the University of the District of Columbia,
was impressed and decided that the Gluu Server was exactly what his campus needed to join InCommon. Delivering
the first Gluu Server into production took three months. The order was placed before Thanksgiving, and it was finally
delivered in early February 2011. Mike helped write some of the python scripts (few, if any of which are still in
use), and establish the operating procedures for delivery of the Gluu Server. In 2011, a few more
campuses also adopted the Gluu Server.</p>
<h2 id="enter-oauth2">Enter OAuth2</h2>
<p>OAuth2 had been on Gluu's roadmap since inception, but work started due to a consulting
project Gluu had undertaken for <a href="https://idcubed.org">IDCubed</a>. This is the reason the OX software is MIT license--IDCubed
insisted on it. The project was a flop--Gluu couldn't deliver the graph based federated data solution quickly
enough. But as a result, Gluu was able to accelerate the launch of the OX OAuth2 based features, first with
OpenID Connect in late 2011. Then in late 2012, Gluu followed by introducing support for the
User Managed Access Protocol, which Mike felt provided an Oauth2 based solution for access management that
was superior to Computer Associates' proprietary Siteminder access management framework.</p>
<h2 id="linux-distribution-packages">Linux Distribution Packages</h2>
<p>At OSCON 2014, Gluu introduced easier to install packages for the Gluu Server, and support for the Ubuntu Juju
orchestration framework. The goal of these distributions was to promote adoption of OX in the major
distributions of linux.</p>

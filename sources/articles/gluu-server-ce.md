# Gluu Server CE QuickStart 

So you want to try out the Gluu Server. The Community Edition (CE) 
is a great place to start. This article will provide an overview of
deployment and testing, so you'll be ready to start integrating 
more apps in the future. 

## Installation

Gluu will publish binaries for as many OS's as possible. Currently, the 
easiest installation option is  
[CENTOS](http://www.gluu.org/docs/admin-guide/installation/centos)

## Installation of the mod_ox for testing

Apologies in advance, but right now we only have a [MS word doucment](http://www.gluu.co/modox_ms_doc)   It will be converted to markdown asap. The instructions are there for 
Apache on Windows, Ubuntu, and Centos.

## Test Use cases

-  Login to oxTrust: test SSO to protected apache folder
-  Login to apache folder: test SSO to oxTrust
-  Logout from apache folder: test logout of oxTrust
-  Logout from oxTrust: test logout of index.html
  
## Next steps

After you try these, you may want to configure open source software
that supports OpenID Connect. 
-  Restart

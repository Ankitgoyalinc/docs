The Gluu Server supports many types of authentication. We are trying to add specific details about how to use commonly used technologies and services. Configuration of the Gluu Server normally includes the creation of a "Custom Authentication Script," which is written in Jython. Sometimes, a third party library will be needed. The sections above are just a starting point. Please help us by contributing documention to as many two-factor authentication API's as possible!

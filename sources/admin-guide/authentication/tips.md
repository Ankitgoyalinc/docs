# Tricks and Troubleshooting tips on authentication

## FAQ

* _I have applied the new authentication script but I am unable to login now. Is there any way I can fix this or revert to previous stable condition?_

    * Yes. First point to be noted that, always use two active browsers if you test new authentication script. In first browser you will be "always logged-in user" and in second browser you will do all kind of testing. If you want to make any changes you can do that in first browser.

    * Authentication scripts are always included in _oxIDPAuthentication_ section. If you want to revert the changes to previous stable condition. Just remove your desired _oxIDPAuthentication_.

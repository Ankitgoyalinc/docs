Welcome to the Gluu Server!

Authenticating people online, and controlling access to API's can be really easy 
if you have the right recipe. 

In the sections listed above you will find some high level information about the
who, what, where, when, and why of the Gluu Server.

Community Support can be found and requested on our [public knowledge base](http://support.gluu.org), while [VIP Support](http://gluu.org/pricing) can be purchased for private assistance, priority responses, and help with the code.

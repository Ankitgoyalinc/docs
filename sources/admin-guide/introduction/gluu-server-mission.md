# Gluu Server Mission 

## The current enviornment 

It is imperative for our society that we decentralize identity. Facebook and Google have bridged our inability
to identify our friends on the Internet by providing a centralized solution–you can share a Google doc with someone
only because they also have a Google account. With a myriad of vendors producing hardware and software that interact
on our behalf, we cannot build our society on these central identity silos. Like enlightened despotism, it seems
efficient. But over time, it undermines the original design goal of the Internet… the largest federation of
autonomous entities ever assembled into one network. The Internet was made possible by standards like tcp/ip, DNS,
http and ssl. After 20 years, we have an Internet identity infrastructure: OpenID Connect. And on top of that we can
build federated authorization and "data federation" (the ability to share private data) not just authentication.

## Our Mission

The mission of the Gluu Server is to provide organizations all over the world with a platform for 
application security that is easy, free, flexible and scalable.

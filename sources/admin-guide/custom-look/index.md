In some cases, the Gluu Server works in the background, and people never even know its there.
However, for certain workflows, the Gluu Server actually presents web pages or messages. Since
we are really bad at design here at Gluu (we're programmers, not designers!) we leave the
design up to you. There are some easy out-of-the box ways to just update the logos and
messages. And then there are more complex methods to provide your own pages, css and images.
See the sections above, depending on which part of the Gluu Server look-and-feel you
want to customize.

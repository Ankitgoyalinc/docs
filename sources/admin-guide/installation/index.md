# Gluu Server Installation

- [Juju](juju.md)
- [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md)
- [Centos](centos.md)

The Gluu Server runs on Linux. Windows and Mac installation are possible, but your mileage may vary.
We also have a [Juju](http://juju.ubuntu.com) based installation method. If you are wondering how
to build the ox Java components, you can see our instructions on the [wiki](http://www.gluu.co/buildox).

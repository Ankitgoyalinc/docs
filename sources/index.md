# Introduction

## History: What did organizations do before the Gluu Server?

For years, deploying an application access management suite was too expensive
for any but the largest enterprises, who engineered tightly bundled proprietary
application security solutions like Oracle Access Manager, IBM Tivoli Access Manager
or CA SiteMinder. These security suites used proprietary protocols and resulted in
“vendor lock-in.” This book documents how to leverage open source software to build
an enterprise class access management system using 100% open source components
that are free to use in production. This recipe has been developed by Gluu over the
last five years, and is proven to work in a variety of deployments around the globe
that vary in size from small to humongous.

## Usage: What can I do with a Gluu Server?

People--employees, customers, and partners-–need to be identified to interact electronically
with an organization. Authentication (_authn_) and authorization (_authz_) is a challenge faced
by almost every organization large enough to register an Internet domain. And it’s not just
people that need to be authenticated and authorized. “Clients” are online agents that can
interact with services on your behalf. With the emergence of the IoT and the API economy,
developers and system administrators are urgently searching for standards based solutions and
best practices to improve the security of web and mobile applications.

While commercial solutions exist, there are many organizations that prefer the do-it-yourself
approach. Authentication impacts the integrity of every transaction performed by a person or
client on the network. In some cases, digital authentication is the organization’s keys to the
kingdom. There are many organizations that will never outsource this function. And there are many
organizations that see excellence in authentication–-which is the front door to their Internet
presence–-as a competitive advantage to drive adoption of their products and services. For these
organizations, the Gluu Server open source recipe for access management is very useful.

## Competitive Advantage: Why does the Gluu Server rock?

The Gluu server makes simple things easy. For example, if your organization has Active Directory,
without writing any custom code, you can map your users, leverage your existing passwords, and
configure SSO with SAML or OpenID Connect websites. Voila!

But for complex deployments, the Gluu Server is both scalable and flexible.  Gluu offers
"interception scripts" which enable you to use Jython to specify custom business logic at
several critical integration points. You can call other APIs (for example fraud detection
or strong authentication) to tie together the components of your security and identity
infrastructure. Interception scripts are the glue of the Gluu Server. You can implement
any crazy plan you can code to define the workflow for authentication, authorization, and
more.

Jython was chosen to make the code easier to change on the fly--no need to compile, build,
and deploy a war file. A savvy system administrator can even do it. Also, interpreted business
logic is easier to replicate in a clustered deployment.

This Gluu Server has more features and is easier to manage than commercial alternatives. This
recipe includes some of the most widely deployed federation components: like the Shibboleth SAML
Identity Provider, and some of the most cutting edge security solutions available anywhere: like
the OX OAuth2 Authorization Server.

Feel confident that you are using the best open source application security software on the
planet and even on the Internet too!

## Mobile: Dude, does it work for mobile or api access management?

Mobile applications are creating new requirements for companies. There has been a paradigm shift
where enterprise services are published with JSON/REST APIs to support both web sites and mobile
apps. Organizations are using more services hosted by third parties. Some web sites are facing
requirements to support the standards based security infrastructures of their customers or partners.

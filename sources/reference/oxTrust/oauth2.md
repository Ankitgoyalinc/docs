## Introduction

Gluu Server has implemented OpenID Connect based on the OAuth 2.0. OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization providing a method for clients to access resources on behalf of a resource owner. OAuth introduces an authorization layer and separates the client from the resource owner. The protocol or framework allows access to the resource without using the credentials of the resource owner but a different set of credentials.

This section has information about how the Gluu Server uses LDAP, and other LDAP recommendations.

The Gluu Server uses LDAP for persistence to store information about things like configuration,
user claims, and client claims. Currently Gluu has the best support for OpenDJ. However, we
hope to catch up soon with regard to OpenLDAP and 389DS. Please help us contribute these
documentation details if you are a guru!

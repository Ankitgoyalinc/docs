# How to calculate and release new attribute in oxTrust 

There are two types of attributes. 1. Standard LDAP attributes 2. Custom
attributes by Organization. Procedure is little bit different for these two
types of attribute which are stated below.

## Standard LDAP attributes

Go to Configuration → Attributes, click on “Show all attributes”. These are
standard LDAP attributes which are already configured in our Gluu Server. If our
desired attribute is in this list, we do not need to “create” it then but we
just need to calculate and map in Gluu Server.

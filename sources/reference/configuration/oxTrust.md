# Gluu Server UI ( oxTrust ) configuration 

oxTrust is a JBoss Seam application that provides organizational cloud identity
management services, including REST service endpoints and a user friendly cloud
identity management console (aka a GUI). 

oxTrust is tightly coupled with oxAuth. oxAuth configuration is stored in LDAP,
and it would be hard to generate the right configuration entries without
oxTrust. The projects are separate projects because in a high throughput cluster
deployment, many oxAuth servers are needed versus a few oxTrust instances.

In this page we are trying to highlight various features of Gluu oxTrust.

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Authenticating people online, and controlling access to API's can be challenging, but if you have the right recipe it is an attainable objective. </p>
<p>In the sections listed below you will find some high level information about the who, what, where, when, and why of the Gluu Server.</p>
<p>Community Support can be found and requested on our <a href="http://support.gluu.org">public knowledge base</a>, while <a href="http://gluu.org/pricing">VIP Support</a> can be purchased for private assistance, priority responses, and help with the code. </p>
<h1 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h1>
<p>Gluu's mission is to help organization's all over the world enforce application security with easy, free, flexible and scalable open source software. </p>
<h1 id="history">History</h1>
<h2 id="how-we-got-started">How we got started</h2>
<p>Gluu was founded in 2009 by Mike Schwartz. After selling his ISP to Verio in 1998, Mike
advised many large companies on identity and access management, directory services, and
application security. In late 2008, Mike had a hunch that Web single sign-on
was too complex, too proprietary and too expensive for many organizations. He felt that
a utility approach to SSO using open source software could provide an alternative to
expensive enterprise solutions. The Gluu Server was envisioned as an integrated
identity platform, based on free open source software, to make application security available
to significantly greater number of organizations.</p>
<h2 id="versions-1-and-2">Versions 1 and 2</h2>
<p>Versions 1 of the Gluu Server was based on Sun OpenSSO and OpenDS. Mike
presented the idea at an OpenSSO community group at the European Identity Conference in Munich in May 2009.
Version 1 worked a little, but there was no easy way to manage it. Version 2 of the Gluu Server had a better UI, but
it was just a facade--the UI didn't actually do anything to configure OpenSSO. Version 2 was launched after
Mike Schwartz met with members of the InCommon steering committee in San Antonio in October 2009.
At that meeting, Mike expressed concern that OpenSSO might be end-of-life. Oracle had recently purchased
Sun Microsystems, and before ForgeRock was formed, it seemed possible that Oracle would simply
migrate OpenSSO customers to Oracle Access Manager. Bob Morgan from the University of Washington convinced Mike that the Shibboleth IDP was a reasonable
alternative, and arguably had even more features in SAML, including fine grain access release policies, and
a better approach for multi-party federation. As the InCommon federation's efforts to evangelize SAML federation
would support Gluu's message, switching had marketing advantages, and would reduce the
event risk around OpenSSO. Shortly thereafter, a
new project from scratch was launched for Gluu Server v3 with the goal of using templates to simplify the
management of the Shibboleth IDP.</p>
<h2 id="version-3">Version 3</h2>
<p>The first live demo of the Gluu Server was at an InCommon event in Atlanta, GA in early November 2010.
At that demo, Hakeem Fahm, then IT director at the University of the District of Columbia,
was impressed and decided that the Gluu Server was exactly what his campus needed to join InCommon. Delivering
the first Gluu Server into production took three months. The order was placed before Thanksgiving, and it was finally
delivered in early February 2011. Mike helped write some of the python scripts (few, if any of which are still in
use), and establish the operating procedures for delivery of the Gluu Server. In 2011, a few more
campuses also adopted the Gluu Server.</p>
<h2 id="enter-oauth2">Enter OAuth2</h2>
<p>OAuth2 had been on Gluu's roadmap since inception, but work started due to a consulting
project Gluu had undertaken for <a href="https://idcubed.org">IDCubed</a>. This is the reason the OX software is MIT license--IDCubed
insisted on it. The project was a flop--Gluu couldn't deliver the graph based federated data solution quickly
enough. But as a result, Gluu was able to accelerate the launch of the OX OAuth2 based features, first with
OpenID Connect in late 2011. Then in late 2012, Gluu followed by introducing support for the
User Managed Access Protocol, which Mike felt provided an Oauth2 based solution for access management that
was superior to Computer Associates' proprietary Siteminder access management framework.</p>
<h2 id="linux-distribution-packages">Linux Distribution Packages</h2>
<p>At OSCON 2014, Gluu introduced easier to install packages for the Gluu Server, and support for the Ubuntu Juju
orchestration framework. The goal of these distributions was to promote adoption of OX in the major
distributions of linux.</p>
<h1 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h1>
<h2 id="free-open-source-identity-suite">Free Open Source Identity Suite</h2>
<p>One of the things that has made access management difficult for
organizations is that there is no one tool you can deploy to solve
even average requirements.  The Gluu Server provides a recipe to 
deploy a combination of the best free open source tools, working 
together.</p>
<h2 id="support-most-promising-open-standards">Support most promising open standards</h2>
<p>The goal of the Gluu Server is to support the minimum number
of standards necessary to authenticate people, and to authorize them
to access the resources they need to do business for the domain.
The Gluu Server should be practical about supporting older protocols, 
but always strive to be the first implementer of the most promising 
new protocols. </p>
<h2 id="leverage-existing-business-processes">Leverage existing business processes</h2>
<p>Where possible, the Gluu Server goes to work with a minimal amount 
of changes to existing business processes. Don't "rip and replace",
but for new applications, use new protocols wherever possible to 
avoid the creation of future upgrade work.</p>
<h2 id="free-license">Free license</h2>
<p>The components of the Gluu Server should be free to use in production.
This license strategy will produce the best software at the lowest 
total cost of ownership for the organization.</p>
<h2 id="write-as-a-last-resort">Write as a last resort</h2>
<p>Use the best software that exists. If something the Gluu Server needs
doesn't exist, it may become an OX project. If some group comes along and
writes software better than an existing OX component, use it!</p>
<h2 id="not-just-comprehensive-but-easy-to-use">Not just comprehensive, but easy to use</h2>
<p>The Gluu Server should make it easy for domain system administrators
to control access to Web and network resources. Usability is more
important than features.</p>
<h2 id="horizontal-scalability">Horizontal scalability</h2>
<p>System administrators should be able to add more servers to make the 
Gluu Server scale as much as needed.</p>
<h2 id="extreme-flexibility">Extreme flexibility</h2>
<p>As Kent Beck says, "Embrace Change". The key to the Gluu Server's succes
has been its ability to handle all sorts of crazy requirements--quickly.
Sometimes raw speed is needed, but equally important is the ability for
the access management framework to be really smart.</p>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>Following is a list of the technical components that comprise the Gluu Server.</p>
<h2 id="j2ee-servlet-container">J2EE Servlet container</h2>
<p>Most of the components of the Gluu Server are written in Java, and deployed as
a web application in a J2EE servlet container. Java was chosen because there is
a wide array of high quality libraries, convenient container services,
and tools for managing high performance applications at run-time. In order to run
the Gluu Server, you don't have to be a Java expert. But it does help to have some
knowledge of how Java applications are deployed and managed in tomcat, or a similar
servlet container.</p>
<h2 id="apache-http-front-end-web-server">Apache HTTP front end web server</h2>
<p>Although there are pros and cons, we think its best to use the Apache HTTPD
server as the Internet facing Web server. There are a number of Apache HTTPD
denial of service plugins. Its easier to handle re-directs for things like
discovery. And its convenient to have a non-J2EE way to publish static content.

<h2 id="ldap-for-persistence">LDAP for Persistence</h2>
<p>LDAP was chosen for persistence for a number of reasons: (1) we understood
how to scale an LDAP directory service horizontally to accommodate a data set
of any size; (2) LDAP servers offer cost-effective and reliable replication
services; (3) as LDAP is a standard, the Gluu server would not be locked into
the persistence solution of one vendor; (4) LDAP had built-in support for SAML
and OAuth2 components. In the future the OX project may develop additional
persistence backends. But this is not likely for the near-term.</p>
<h2 id="memcached">memcached</h2>
<p>Memcached is used on both the Gluu Server, and to cache authorization decisions
for the OX web container plugins. It is easy to configure and there were tools
to enable memcached clusters (thanks Twitter!).</p>
<h2 id="web-container-plugins">Web container plugins</h2>
<p>Today, Web access management tools like CA Siteminder predominantly use the web
agent approach. Many large organizations have hundreds or thousands of "web agents"
running on Apache and IIS.</p>
<p>Web agents are a great approach. Programmers don't have to know much about the
protocols. System administrators can configure the web server to use
the central authorization server so we don't have to rely on the programmers to get
security right. The programmers can obtain the user session information in the
environment variables. In OAuth2 information is serialized using JSON. For example, the
entire id_token JWT is sent in one environment variable.</p>
<p>If developers want even more control, they can use the Gluu Server's API's directly: SAML, 
OpenID Connect, or UMA.</p>
